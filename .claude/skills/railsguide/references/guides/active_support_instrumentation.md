## 1. Introduction to Instrumentation
The instrumentation API provided by Active Support allows developers to provide hooks which other developers may hook into. There are several of these within the Rails framework. With this API, developers can choose to be notified when certain events occur inside their application or another piece of Ruby code.
For example, there is a hook provided within Active Record that is called every time Active Record uses an SQL query on a database. This hook could be **subscribed** to, and used to track the number of queries during a certain action. There's another hook around the processing of an action of a controller. This could be used, for instance, to track how long a specific action has taken.
You are even able to create your own events inside your application which you can later subscribe to.

## 2. Subscribing to an Event
Use [`ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html#method-c-subscribe) with a block to listen to any notification. Depending on the amount of arguments the block takes, you will receive different data.
The first way to subscribe to an event is to use a block with a single argument. The argument will be an instance of [`ActiveSupport::Notifications::Event`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications/Event.html).

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "process_action.action_controller" do |event|
  event.name        # => "process_action.action_controller"
  event.duration    # => 10 (in milliseconds)
  event.allocations # => 1826
  event.payload     # => {:extra=>information}

Rails.logger.info "#{event} Received!"
end

```
Copy
If you don't need all the data recorded by an Event object, you can also specify a block that takes the following five arguments:
  * Name of the event
  * Time when it started
  * Time when it finished
  * A unique ID for the instrumenter that fired the event
  * The payload for the event

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "process_action.action_controller" do |name, started, finished, unique_id, payload|

# your own custom stuff
  Rails.logger.info "#{name} Received! (started: #{started}, finished: #{finished})" # process_action.action_controller Received! (started: 2019-05-05 13:43:57 -0800, finished: 2019-05-05 13:43:58 -0800)
end

```
Copy
If you are concerned about the accuracy of `started` and `finished` to compute a precise elapsed time, then use [`ActiveSupport::Notifications.monotonic_subscribe`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html#method-c-monotonic_subscribe). The given block would receive the same arguments as above, but the `started` and `finished` will have values with an accurate monotonic time instead of wall-clock time.

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.monotonic_subscribe "process_action.action_controller" do |name, started, finished, unique_id, payload|

# your own custom stuff
  duration = finished - started # 1560979.429234 - 1560978.425334
  Rails.logger.info "#{name} Received! (duration: #{duration})" # process_action.action_controller Received! (duration: 1.0039)
end

```
Copy
You may also subscribe to events matching a regular expression. This enables you to subscribe to multiple events at once. Here's how to subscribe to everything from `ActionController`:

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe(/action_controller/) do |event|

# inspect all ActionController events
end

```
Copy

```
Copy
If the query is not executed in the context of a transaction, `:transaction` is `nil`.

#### 3.9.2. `strict_loading_violation.active_record`
This event is only emitted when [`config.active_record.action_on_strict_loading_violation`](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#config-active-record-action-on-strict-loading-violation) is set to `:log`.
| Key  | Value  |

| `:reflection`  | Reflection of the association that tried to load  |

#### 3.9.3. `instantiation.active_record`

#### 3.9.4. `start_transaction.active_record`
This event is emitted when a transaction has been started.
| Key  | Value  |
| --- | --- |
| `:transaction`  | Transaction object  |
| `:connection`  | Connection object  |
Please, note that Active Record does not create the actual database transaction until needed:

```
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do

# We are inside the block, but no event has been triggered yet.

# The following line makes Active Record start the transaction.
  User.count # Event fired here.
end

```
Copy
Remember that ordinary nested calls do not create new transactions:

```
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do |t1|
  User.count # Fires an event for t1.
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do |t2|
    # The next line fires no event for t2, because the only
    # real database transaction in this example is t1.
    User.first.touch
  end
end

```
Copy
However, if `requires_new: true` is passed, you get an event for the nested transaction too. This might be a savepoint under the hood:

```
ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do |t1|
  User.count # Fires an event for t1.
  ActiveRecord::Base.transaction(requires_new: true) do |t2|
    User.first.touch # Fires an event for t2.
  end
end

#### 3.9.5. `transaction.active_record`
This event is emitted when a database transaction finishes. The state of the transaction can be found in the `:outcome` key.

| --- | --- |
| `:transaction`  | Transaction object  |
| `:outcome`  |  `:commit`, `:rollback`, `:restart`, or `:incomplete`  |
| `:connection`  | Connection object  |
In practice, you cannot do much with the transaction object, but it may still be helpful for tracing database activity. For example, by tracking `transaction.uuid`.

#### 3.9.6. `deprecated_association.active_record`
This event is emitted when a deprecated association is accessed, and the configured deprecated associations mode is `:notify`.
| Key  | Value  |
| --- | --- |
| `:reflection`  | The reflection of the association  |
| `:message`  | A descriptive message about the access  |
| `:location`  | The application-level location of the access  |
| `:backtrace`  | Only present if the option `:backtrace` is true  |
The `:location` is a `Thread::Backtrace::Location` object, and `:backtrace`, if present, is an array of `Thread::Backtrace::Location` objects. These are computed using the Active Record backtrace cleaner. In Rails applications, this is the same as `Rails.backtrace_cleaner`.

## 5. Creating Custom Events
Adding your own events is easy as well. Active Support will take care of all the heavy lifting for you. Simply call [`ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument`](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v8.1.3/classes/ActiveSupport/Notifications.html#method-c-instrument) with a `name`, `payload`, and a block. The notification will be sent after the block returns. Active Support will generate the start and end times, and add the instrumenter's unique ID. All data passed into the `instrument` call will make it into the payload.
Here's an example:

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument "my.custom.event", this: :data do

# do your custom stuff here
end

```
Copy
Now you can listen to this event with:

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "my.custom.event" do |name, started, finished, unique_id, data|
  puts data.inspect # {:this=>:data}
end

```
Copy
You may also call `instrument` without passing a block. This lets you leverage the instrumentation infrastructure for other messaging uses.

```
ActiveSupport::Notifications.instrument "my.custom.event", this: :data

ActiveSupport::Notifications.subscribe "my.custom.event" do |name, started, finished, unique_id, data|
  puts data.inspect # {:this=>:data}
end

```
Copy
You should follow Rails conventions when defining your own events. The format is: `event.library`. If your application is sending Tweets, you should create an event named `tweet.twitter`.
